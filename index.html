                  During our ongoing engagements within Defence, Government and
                  large scale corporate organisations, we have consistently
                  identified a failure of recruitment agencies, consulting
                  organisations and suppliers to correctly analyse the
                  requirements for individual roles and larger workforce teams.
                  This failure invariably leads to poor outcomes for the client,
                  high turnover within the workforce, and has a detrimental
                  impact on the individuals placed into roles that were outside
                  their skill and experience.
                </p>

                  With our extensive experience in the analysis and design of

                  requirements, and subsequently sourcing and managing high

                          This is always a good place to start—consulting is a
                          vague field to the average person. Therefore, many
                          people might not even realize that they need or could
                          benefit from consulting services. This is your chance
                          to educate them and to show off your skills. If people
                          don’t know what a consultant is or does, how can they
                          know that they need one? It might seem like a simple
                          question to you, an industry expert, but to the
                          average user, it’s a big question that gets huge hits
                          in search engine results. Explain all the details of
                          what you do, what you don’t do, and give people room
                          to ask more questions if they’d like. This is a great
                          place to encourage people to reach out to you via
                          email, live chat, or another means of communication to
                          ask questions and discuss their specific needs.

                          First, note that we ask “why”, not “if”—this
                          eliminates the chance for people to think they don’t
                          need a business consultant. Use this question to point
                          out all the perks that come from working with a
                          consultant and help people see what value you have to
                          offer for their business. SMBs, especially, can stand
                          to gain a lot of valuable insight because they may not
                          be as familiar with the consulting industry as others
                          in business. This question gives you a chance to sell
                          your services and show people all that you can do. It
                          also allows you to inform them of just what a business
                          consultant does.

                          This is a question on everyone’s list. People like to
                          know prices, even when they don’t realize it’s
                          something that can’t just be quoted outright. Sure,
                          there are “average” rates for consultants, and you can
                          use this area to discuss what your rates are or how
                          much the average business spends on consulting, but
                          you will never be able to give people a locked-in
                          price. The point here is to be transparent about your
                          pricing and make sure that people understand how you
                          charge more so than what you charge (plus, that’s
                          another question we’ll cover in a minute). Your
                          explanation of the pricing and variables in estimating
                          costs is more valuable than the actual numbers,
                          anyway.

                          Businesses in need of help often find themselves
                          struggling to figure out what coaches and consultants
                          do, and what makes them different from each other.
                          After all, at first glance, they seem like they offer
                          similar services. However, that’s far from reality.
                          Coaches are trained to actively coach businesses on
                          how to become successful and build a better company.
                          They also coach the leader(s) of the business on how
                          to be confident and improve personally to help their
                          professional career. A consultant is more of an
                          advisory type of person—they will consult on various
                          processes and practices within the business to help
                          make improvements and will generally not offer a lot
                          of personal advice or focus on personal growth as much
                          as the business itself. In either case, both can
                          benefit a business in the right situation.

                          This is a big point of contention in the industry—most
                          people will offer at least a phone call or quick chat
                          without a charge, but some balk at the idea entirely.
                          However, if you do offer some type of free consult to
                          your clients or potential clients, you could gain a
                          lot more business than you might expect. Be sure to
                          explain exactly what you can do for people and how you
                          can assist them, and then discuss what your fees will
                          be if they decide to continue working with you. When
                          you focus on problem-solving more than pricing, so
                          will they.
